  technique, measure, mse, graph_file_name, timepoint = NULL,
  output_format)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed}{Observed dataset (testing or validation)}

\item{predicted}{Predicted dataset}

\item{technique}{The machine learning technique used to develop the emulator}

\item{measure}{The simulation output response being plotted}

\item{mse}{Mean Squared Error between predicted and observed}

\item{graph_file_name}{Name to give the produced PDF plot}

\item{timepoint}{If using multiple timepoints, the timepoint for which the
emulator has been created}

\item{output_format}{File format in which this graph is being produced}
}
